		<BR>Easy: Aim for Luna to get points. If you shoot the "good ponies", you get one point off!! Don't touch the bomb, otherwise you are screwed. </BR>
		<BR>Hard: Catch the "good ponies", which means every pony except Luna and Discort!! If you catch them, you lose points!! Watch out because you have limited time to pass the level!</BR> 
		<BR>Each version has two levels.</BR>
